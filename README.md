## Projects
### FAMOUS PAINTINGS AND ARTISTS
[Project](https://github.com/mrunalibharshankar/SQL_Tableau.git)
- The goal was to make meaningfull insights about the 100,000 records containing 8 different tables about painting, artist, cost, museum details.
- Analysed and manipulated data in excel followed by using Joins, CTE, Windows function in mysql and finally visualized the data in tableau.
- In tableau, with the help of filters, calculated fields and set function created dynamic dashboard.

### Customer Churn Analysis
[Project](https://github.com/mrunalibharshankar/RegressionAnalysis.git)
- Predict the top attribute related to CustomerChurnRate, the goal was to understand how the independent variables impact the dependent variable.
- Analysed the dataset and transformed new column to find duplicate records. Created PivotChart to findout ChurnRate across Region, No of Products customer uses, Gender, and Tenure with bank with CreditScore. Performed Regression analysis with the help of Excel Data Analysis tool.
- The p-value of CreditScore was 0.007 (< 0.05), it determined the significant relationship between CredtiScore(independent variable) and Exited (dependent variable) and R-squared of CreditScore was 0.0008 is 0.08% proportion of variance in Exited variable which is very less but better than other variables to consider, also the coefficients that result in the smallest residual sum of squares with best fit line.

### Employee Retention using a Regression and Machine learning model
[Project](https://github.com/mrunalibharshankar/Python.git)
- The goals in this project was to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.
- Built Logistic Regression models with Cross validation, Random Forest and Decision Tree model with Gridsearch on evaluation metrics(f1, accuracy, AUC, recall, precision) with classification report.
- From the evalution random forest models, last_evaluation, number_project, tenure, and overworked have the highest importance, in that order. These variables are most helpful in predicting the outcome variable, left, and they are the same as the ones used by the decision tree model.
- Conclusion was the logistic regression model achieved precision of 80%, recall of 83%, f1-score of 80% (all weighted averages), and accuracy of 83%, on the test set and the decision tree model achieved AUC of 95.65%, precision of 97.59%, recall of 90.4%, f1-score of 94.58%, and accuracy of 98.23%, on the test set. The random forest modestly outperformed the decision tree model.

### CLASSIFICATION OF TIK TOK VIDEOS	
[Project](https://github.com/mrunalibharshankar/Classification-using-ML.git)

- TikTok wants to build a machine learning model to help identify claims and opinions. A machine learning model would greatly assist in the effort to present human moderators with videos that are most likely to be in violation of TikTok's terms of service.
- Performed data cleaning and text analysis to successfully identified the claims and opinions.
- Applied regression and machine learning to produce a final model with an accuracy of 99.32%.
